![ScriptersCF Rules](Rules.png)
- **You must be 13+**. In line with Discord's guidelines, we unfortunately cannot allow you to join our server if you are under 13.
- **Treat everyone with respect**. If you have a disagreement, you should either block the user or settle it with Direct Messages.
- **Avoid "memeing" and trolling**. Generally, anything that could disrupt more relevant conversations should be taken to #off-topic.
- **Follow staff instructions**. Depending on the situation, failure to do so may result in punishment.
- **You are responsible for your account**. Whether you or your brother broke our rules, you will be held accountable for it.
- **No NSFW content/discussion**. If you're unsure, it's probably best you ask a staff member first, or simply don't send it.
- **No raiding**. Raids will not be tolerated and will generally result in a permanent ban.
- **No scamming**. While we are not responsible for trading, we will make an effort to ban any scammers to protect the community.
- **No selling accounts or currency**. As these are generally acquired unethically, this is strictly prohibited.
- **No spamming**. This includes sending consecutive messages too quickly, or sending meaningless messages.
- **No bypassing the filter**. The filter is here for a reason. You must not attempt to find ways of avoiding it.
- **No selfbots/userbots**. You must not use bots that run on your Discord account.
- **No racial slurs**. Racial and derogatory terms are not allowed here, as they can easily offend members.
- **No distributing/asking for help with exploits**. You may still discuss exploiting in favour of learning about your own game security.
- **No excessive swearing**. While you *are* allowed to swear, you shouldn't swear excessively as it could become disruptive.
- **No advertising**. Please don't advertise here, we have #advertising for a reason!
- **No discussing moderation actions**. To prevent a toxic environment, you should contact staff directly instead.
- **No reporting scammers publicly**. Similarly to above, you must report scammers directly to staff members.
- **No trading outside of selling & hiring**. This is to protect our community. This also includes sending unsolicited DMs to members.
- **No suspicious links**. Shortened links are generally not allowed. Posting a malicious link may result in an instant ban.
- **No executable files**. An exception to this is when you get explicit permission from a staff member.
