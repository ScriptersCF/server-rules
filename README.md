![ScriptersCF Rules](Rules.png)
- **You must be 13+**. In line with Discord's guidelines, we unfortunately cannot allow you to join our server if you are under 13.
- **Treat everyone with respect**. If you have a disagreement, you should either block the user or settle it with Direct Messages.
- **Avoid "memeing" and trolling**. Generally, anything that could disrupt more relevant conversations should be taken to #off-topic.
- **Follow staff instructions**. Depending on the situation, failure to do so may result in punishment.
- **You are responsible for your account**. Whether you or your brother broke our rules, you will be held accountable for it.
- **No NSFW content/discussion**. If you're unsure, it's probably best you ask a staff member first, or simply don't send it.
- **No raiding**. Raids will not be tolerated and will generally result in a permanent ban.
- **No scamming**. While we are not responsible for trading, we will make an effort to ban any scammers to protect the community.
- **No selling accounts or currency**. As these are generally acquired unethically, this is strictly prohibited.
- **No spamming**. This includes sending consecutive messages too quickly, or sending meaningless messages.
- **No bypassing the filter**. The filter is here for a reason. You must not attempt to find ways of avoiding it.
- **No selfbots/userbots**. You must not use bots that run on your Discord account.
- **No racial slurs**. Racial and derogatory terms are not allowed here, as they can easily offend members.
- **No distributing/asking for help with exploits**. You may still discuss exploiting in favour of learning about your own game security.
- **No excessive swearing**. While you *are* allowed to swear, you shouldn't swear excessively as it could become disruptive.
- **No advertising**. Please don't advertise here, we have #advertising for a reason!
- **No discussing moderation actions**. To prevent a toxic environment, you should contact staff directly instead.
- **No reporting scammers publicly**. Similarly to above, you must report scammers directly to staff members.
- **No trading outside of selling & hiring**. This is to protect our community. This also includes sending unsolicited DMs to members.
- **No suspicious links**. Shortened links are generally not allowed. Posting a malicious link may result in an instant ban.
- **No executable files**. An exception to this is when you get explicit permission from a staff member.

*Note: The rules are simply guidelines that are designed to give you a general idea on what you can and can't do in our server. As such, discretion will be used when moderating, which means you may still be punished for bad behaviour even if not specified here.*
